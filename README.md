This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It demonstrates the use of react router v4 on its own, and with react-router-redux

Additionally there s a higher-order component (HOC) that animates page transitions.

the INC/DEC counter just shows how things work with other reducers.


i only did the HOC, the other stuff comes from "react-redux-example".
